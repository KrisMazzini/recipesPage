                <h2>Fake Carbonara</h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to be a Spaghetti Carbonara, however I&apos;m 
                    nowhere close to have the necessary skills for that, so I used my creativity.
                    It&apos;s good enough to impress your friends though.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. If the whole spaghetti does not fit in, there&apos;s something wrong.</li>
                    <li>When the water starts boiling, put the spaghetti to cook and leave it until it looks eatable.</li>
                    <li>Put salt in the boiling water accordingly to your taste. BE CAREFUL.</li>
                    <li>Chop the 150g of pancetta as finely as you can, or simply buy one that&apos;s already chopped.</li>
                    <li>Fry the pancetta, it does not taste good raw.</li>
                    <li>Chop the blue cheese and the other cheese you&apos;ve chosen, then mix them.</li>
                    <li>In another pan, put the heavy cream to boil with the cheese mix and more salt. Do not put it in the same pan as the boiling water.</li>
                    <li>Stir the heavy cream until the cheese is fully melted, then you have your sauce.</li>
                    <li>Lift the spaghetti from the water and put it in the sauce, along with the pancetta.</li>
                    <li>If you want eggs, scramble them in a frying pan and add it to the mix.</li>
                    <li>Use a plate and a fork to eat.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <ul>
                    <li>You can use this recipe in larger scales, depending on how much leftovers you want to keep in the fridge.</li>
                    <li>For vegetarians, the pancetta can be removed from the recipe and it will still be great.</li>

                <h2>Scrambled Cheese With Eggs</h2>
                <p>
                    It&apos;s just scrambled eggs, but if you put more and more cheese, it tastes better.

                <ul>
                    <li>4 eggs</li>
                    <li>300g of cheese</li>
                    <li>200g of beef, chicken or sausage</li>

            <section class="steps">
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Just scramble the eggs with all the cheese you got.</li>
                    <li>Add salt accordingly to your taste.</li>
                    <li>If you think that you&apos;ll still be hungry, prepare some meat as well: just cook it with salt, it doesn&apos;t have to taste good, you&apos;ll just mix it with the eggs.</li>
                    <li>In case you don&apos;t have or don&apos;t eat meat, use bread instead.</li>
                    <li>If you also don&apos;t have bread, just make more eggs and use more cheese.</li>
                    <li>Don&apos;t have it? I can only be sorry then.</li>
                </ol>
